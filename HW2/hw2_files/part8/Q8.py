# Write a program to detect the guess word in each row of the input image and print it on the screen in all-caps.
# Don't print anything for the empty rows (if any) at the bottom of the image.
# The output in this case is not an image, but text in ASCII format that is printed on the screen.
# For example, for the test image shown below the output should be
#
# CLOUD
#
# BLUNT
#
# ULTRA
