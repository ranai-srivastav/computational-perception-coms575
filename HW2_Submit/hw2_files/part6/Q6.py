# Find all vowels within the grid and replace each with the same letter but in a different font.
#
# You will have to make your own templates for the new versions of the six vowels, or figure out some other way to print
# text to an image at the right pixel coordinates. Cutouts of all symbols used in this problem can be found in the
# letter_cutouts folder.
