# This is the same as problem 8, but now also print two integers after each word that indicate the quality of the guess.
# The first integer indicates the number of letters in correct positions (green squares).
# The second integer maps to the correct letters but in wrong positions (orange squares).
#
# For example:
#
# CLOUD 1 1
#
# BLUNT 1 2
#
# ULTRA 5 0
