# Solve at least two Wordle puzzles by playing the game online (Wordle).
# Take screenshots of the browser window as you play the game (after each guess).
# Then, run these images through your program. This is essentially the same as problem 9,
# but with images that you generated. Make sure to match the scale (or image resolution)
# in order to use the same letter templates. Note: For this problem, you may have to create
# your own letter templates by cropping them from the new test images using your favorite image editor.
